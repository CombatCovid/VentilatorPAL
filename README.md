# VentilatorPAL

## Project description

VentilatorPAL and VentilatorPAL Pro offer a solution for the acute lack of respirators for COVID-19 patients around the world. Our ventilators can only be used under supervision of a doctor. VentilatorPAL is available as an open source low-cost DIY kit that can be assembled by anyone. The ventilatorâ€™s schematics and software can also be downloaded for free as an open source project. VentilatorPAL Pro is a medically certified version with upgraded build-quality that can be used in complement with high-end ventilators to free up capacity at the IC.

The project is run by [FreeBreathing.org](https://freebreathing.org). VentilatorPAL was designed and built by Cosmicnode and Stogger with help of M.D. Hugo Touw of RadboudUMC. We believe that everybody should have access to a ventilator in times of medical crisis. That is why they made a simple design that is open source, meaning it is affordable and easy to manufacture.
